# Introduction

The build script consists of two parts, the "outside" build-script (called build-dev-env.sh) and the "inside" build-scripts (in the tarball build-scripts.tar.gz).

Executing ./build-dev-env.sh <container name> will make the "outside" script start a container name <container name>, wait for the containers network to settle, push the "inside" script tarball to the container, extract the tarball and execute the "inside" build script to actually install the dependencies and so.

Besides the actual build-scripts, there is a lxd-config.sh script that will create a x11 profile (based off the x11.lxd.profile file) and output some instructions on how you can use the profile.

# LXD stuff

To bind mount a folder from the host into the container, for example to gather logs from the container, you can do the following:
* Ensure that the bind-mount is in one of the profiles that the container has, an example profile to bind /path/to/logs from the host to /logs in the container would be the following:
> config: {}
> description: ""
> devices:
>   logs:
>     path: /logs
>     source: /path/to/logs
>     type: disk
> name: logs-directory

* It can also be done on a ad-hoc basis with the following command: lxc config device add <container name> <mount tag, can be anything> disk source=/path/to/logs path=/logs
